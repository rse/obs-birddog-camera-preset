OBS-Birddog-Camera-Preset
=========================

**Recalling a Birddog Camera Preset from within OBS Studio**

About
-----

This is a small HTML5 Single-Page-Application (SPA) for interactively
controlling the position and/or size of one or more related *Crop/Pad*
source filters in [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) through a remote
[OBS WebSocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket) connection.
The transition from the old to the new crop position and/or size is
performed over a configured time duration and with a cubic in/out
easing, in order to somewhat simulate the behaviour of a PTZ camera.

This SPA can be running inside a separate Browser, inside a *Custom
Browser Dock* of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com), or even inside a
[OBS Source Dock](https://github.com/exeldro/obs-source-dock) inside [OBS
Studio](https://obsproject.com).
